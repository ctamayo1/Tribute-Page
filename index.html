<p> Born in 1412, Jeanne d’Arc (or in English, Joan of Arc) was the daughter of a tenant farmer, Jacques d’Arc, from the village of Domrémy, in northeastern France.</p>
  <p>At the age of 13, Joan began to hear voices, which she determined had been sent by God to give her a mission of overwhelming importance: to save France by expelling its enemies, and to install <a class = 'orange-font' target= '_blank' href = 'https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-VII-king-of-France' >Charles VII </a> as its rightful king. </p>
  <p> At the age of 16, after her father attempted to arrange a marriage for her, she successfully convinced a local court that she should not be forced to accept the match.</p>
    <p> March of 1429, Jeanne d’Arc fought victoriously in the <a class = 'orange-font' target= '_blank' href = 'https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/siege-of-orleans'>Siege of Orléans </a> dressed in white armor and riding a white horse.
    <p>In the spring of 1430, the king ordered Joan to confront a <a class = 'orange-font' target= '_blank' href= 'https://www.sparknotes.com/biography/joanofarc/section8/'>Burgundian assault</a> on Compiégne.The Burgundians took her captive and brought her amid much fanfare to the castle of Bouvreuil, occupied by the English commander at Rouen.</p>
    <p>In the trial that followed, Joan was ordered to answer to some 70 charges against her, including witchcraft, heresy and dressing like a man. </p>
    <p>On the morning of May 30, 1431, at the age of 19, Joan was taken to the old marketplace of Rouen and burned at the stake.</p>
    <p>In 1909 Joan of Arc was beatified in the famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris by Pope Pius X. A statue inside the <a class = 'orange-font' target = '_blank' href = 'https://live.staticflickr.com/2121/1950434521_53ab92ac1d_b.jpg'>Notre Dame Cathedral</a> pays tribute to her legacy.</p>
    <p>Pope Benedict XV <a class = 'orange-font' target= '_blank' href = 'https://www.jeanne-darc.info/biography/canonization/'>canonized</a> her in 1920, becoming the patron saint of France.
